# Welcome to ProjectBuddies!

It's an application that helps people find a crew member or join existing team for laboratory or project classes. In times of a pandemic, we are forced to create groups online. This is a big handicap, especially for people who are new and don't know anyone. 

# Functionality

 * Creating new room and invite friends.
 * Joining an existing room by passing key.
 * Setting up profile which allow for self-presentations. The profile can includes information such as about you,  experience, projects, soft skills, hard skills, hobbies.
 * Adding group into room and inform that the group is looking for members.
 * Expressing willingness to join a given group.
 * Notifications when some members wish to join the group.
 
# Implementation
* Programming language - Swift
* Database - Firebase
